Problem Description 1

Given a binary matrix A of size N x M.

 Cells which contain 1 are called filled cell and cell that contain 0 are called empty cell.

Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region. Find the length of the largest region.

Problem Constraints
 1 <= N, M <= 102

 A[i][j]=0 or A[i][j]=1


  
Problem Description 2
  
Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M in which each row is sorted.

Find an return the overall median of the matrix A.

Note: No extra memory is allowed.

Note: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right..
  
                       
                               

                               
                               
Problem Description 3-

 Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we can’t take its any children or parents in consideration and vice versa.

                                               
 1 ≤ Number of nodes in the tree ≤ 10000
1 ≤ Value of each node ≤ 100000
