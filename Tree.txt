Problem Description-

Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we can’t take its any children or parents in consideration and vice versa.

1 ≤ Number of nodes in the tree ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Value of each node ≤ 100000
